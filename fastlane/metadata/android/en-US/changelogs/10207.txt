Added
- Share uploads now run in the main file browser with a single, cancellable transfer dialog.
- Batch upload for multiple shared files with unified, smoother progress.
- Reliable URI access: self‑granted/persistable read permissions and ClipData propagation.

Changed
- Simplified Share screen: confirms, hands off, and finishes; progress lives in FileBrowser.
- Notification deep‑links open directly into the transfer dialog and target path.

Fixed
- Uploads keep running in background; no more accidental cancellations or window leaks.
- Prevented duplicate Recents entries; improved multi‑file reliability during staging.
