* Unified transfer pipeline with status flags + replayable progress.
* Cancel actions in UI (cancelUpload, cancelDownload).
* Background search with cancellable progress dialog.
* SAF folder upload: structure, overwrite prompts, multi-file progress, cleanup.
* Edge-to-edge display via androidx.activity EdgeToEdge (borderless, backward-compatible).
* Transfer dialog now driven by FileOperationsViewModel state.
* Smoother progress (throttled, monotonic %, byte-based, finalizing phase).
* Closed dialogs in onDestroy() to prevent leaks.
* Safer UI access in ProgressController.
* FABs (Upload/Create Folder) visible in empty folders.
